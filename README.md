# Data Modeling

1Ô∏è‚É£**Star Schema Foundation:** I initially constructed a *Star schema* with a Sales fact table, complemented by six-dimensional tables consisting of Product, Customer, Address, Campaign, Manufacturer, and Date, providing a clear structure for insights.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Enhanced Depth with Additional Fact & Dimensions:** Next, I introduced another *Star schema* based on a Budget fact table, alongside two additional dimensional tables, Category/Segment and Date, enriching the model's scope and segmentation capabilities.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Transition to Snowflake Schema:** Finally, I combined both *Star schemas*, evolving the model into a *Snowflake schema*. This design optimizes data organization, allowing for more complex queries and improved performance.

üîç **Outcome:** With this setup, the resulting model supports flexible, detailed analysis and provides a robust framework for tracking key performance metrics, budgeting trends, and more. It‚Äôs an excellent setup for strategic insights and decision-making in Power BI!
